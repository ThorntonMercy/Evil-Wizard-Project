-- Evil Wizard --

Health is 450 to give more of a challenge for a 2 player team. 

Dark Blast 	deals 1-1.4x attack power
Blazing Inferno 	50% attack power but inflicts a burn on himself and the player that lasts for 3 turns 
Blight	deals 20-40% attack power 



-- Other Mechanics -- 

Left the turn mechanic alone to not verify if a move was still on cooldown and could therefore not be used, as I liked the consequences of not paying attention during gameplay. 

Introduction of an Ally class, which is a randomly chosen NPC that can be any of the character classes minus the playerâ€™s chosen class or Evil Wizard. 

Fairy Healing - randomized healing

Call for Healing - guaranteed healing
